# FunASR: A Fundamental End-to-End Speech Recognition Toolkit

<strong>FunASR</strong> hopes to build a bridge between academic research and industrial applications on speech recognition. By supporting the training & finetuning of the industrial-grade speech recognition model released on [ModelScope](https://www.modelscope.cn/models?page=1&tasks=auto-speech-recognition), researchers and developers can conduct research and production of speech recognition models more conveniently, and promote the development of speech recognition ecology.

## Release Notes: 
### 2023.1.16, funasr-0.1.6
- We release a new version model [Paraformer-large-long](https://modelscope.cn/models/damo/speech_paraformer-large-vad-punc_asr_nat-zh-cn-16k-common-vocab8404-pytorch/summary), which integrate the [VAD](https://modelscope.cn/models/damo/speech_fsmn_vad_zh-cn-16k-common-pytorch/summary) model, [ASR](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/damo/speech_paraformer-large_asr_nat-zh-cn-16k-common-vocab8404-pytorch/summary),
 [Punctuation](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/damo/punc_ct-transformer_zh-cn-common-vocab272727-pytorch/summary) model and timestamp together. The model could take in several hours long inputs.
- We release a new type model, [VAD](https://modelscope.cn/models/damo/speech_fsmn_vad_zh-cn-16k-common-pytorch/summary), which could predict the duration of none-silence speech. It could be freely integrated with any ASR models in [Model Zoo](docs/modelscope_models.md).
- We release a new type model, [Punctuation](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/damo/punc_ct-transformer_zh-cn-common-vocab272727-pytorch/summary), which could predict the punctuation of ASR models's results. It could be freely integrated with any ASR models in [Model Zoo](docs/modelscope_models.md).
- We release a new model, [Data2vec](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/damo/speech_data2vec_pretrain-zh-cn-aishell2-16k-pytorch/summary), an unsupervised pretraining model which could be finetuned on ASR and other downstream tasks.
- We release a new model, [Paraformer-Tiny](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/damo/speech_paraformer-tiny-commandword_asr_nat-zh-cn-16k-vocab544-pytorch/summary), a lightweight Paraformer model which supports Mandarin command words recognition.
- We release a new type model, [SV](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/damo/speech_xvector_sv-zh-cn-cnceleb-16k-spk3465-pytorch/summary), which could extract speaker embeddings and further perform speaker verification on paired utterances. It will be supported for speaker diarization in the future version.
- We improve the pipeline of modelscope to speedup the inference, by integrating the process of build model into build pipeline.
- Various new types of audio input types are now supported by modelscope inference pipeline, including wav.scp, wav format, audio bytes, wave samples...

## Key Features
- Many types of typical models are supported, e.g., [Tranformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762), [Conformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08100), [Paraformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08317).
- We have released large number of academic and industrial pretrained models on [ModelScope](https://www.modelscope.cn/models?page=1&tasks=auto-speech-recognition)
- The pretrained model [Paraformer-large](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/damo/speech_paraformer-large_asr_nat-zh-cn-16k-common-vocab8404-pytorch/summary) obtains the best performance on many tasks in [SpeechIO leaderboard](https://github.com/SpeechColab/Leaderboard)
- FunASR supplies a easy-to-use pipeline to finetune pretrained models from [ModelScope](https://www.modelscope.cn/models?page=1&tasks=auto-speech-recognition)
- Compared to [Espnet](https://github.com/espnet/espnet) framework, the training speed of large-scale datasets in FunASR is much faster owning to the optimized dataloader.
